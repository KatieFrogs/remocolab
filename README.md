# remocolab
A fork of [remocolab](https://github.com/demotomohiro/remocolab) that ditches SSH support and uses [noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC) as a viewer instead. Also makes some changes like enabling passwordless sudo, and installing Chromium and Noto fonts.

Instructions are detailed in the [notebook](remocolab.ipynb).
